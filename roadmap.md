# App Development Roadmap

## 1. **Initial Setup**:
- [ ] Project Initialization (If not done).
- [ ] Install necessary libraries and tools (e.g., `react-router-dom`, `eslint`, `prettier`).
- [ ] Setup your code style and linters.

## 2. **Architectural Decisions**:
- [ ] Decide on a folder structure for your project.
- [ ] Determine the state management solution (context, Redux, MobX, etc.).
- [ ] Consider if SSR (using Next.js or another tool) would be beneficial for your project.

## 3. **Routing & Navigation**:
- [ ] Integrate `react-router-dom`.
- [ ] Create the main routes (e.g., LandingPage, Recipient, Review, Pay).
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for each route.

## 4. **State Management**:
- [ ] Set up Context API or your chosen state management solution.
- [ ] Determine global state shape and actions.
- [ ] Implement context providers and custom hooks for state consumption.

## 5. **Component Development**:
- [ ] Create reusable UI components (buttons, input fields, modals, etc.).
- [ ] Use TypeScript for type safety.
- [ ] Implement error boundaries for graceful error handling.

## 6. **Optimization**:
- [ ] Implement React's best practices like memoization (`useMemo`, `React.memo()`) to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- [ ] Optimize images and other static assets.
- [ ] Implement code splitting beyond just routing (e.g., load modals or other large components on demand).

## 7. **Backend Integration** (if you have a backend):
- [ ] Set up API endpoints.
- [ ] Integrate endpoints with frontend, consider using a library like Axios.
- [ ] Handle API errors gracefully.

## 8. **Testing**:
- [ ] Set up Jest and React Testing Library.
- [ ] Write unit tests for utility functions and components.
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests with Cypress or Puppeteer.

## 9. **Performance Analysis**:
- [ ] Use React's Profiler and Chrome's Performance tab to analyze and optimize renders.
- [ ] Optimize any bottlenecks or slow components.

## 10. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**:
- [ ] Use service workers to cache assets.
- [ ] Add a manifest file for PWA capabilities.

## 11. **Documentation**:
- [ ] Document the main parts of the application.
- [ ] If using a component library, consider using Storybook.

## 12. **Continuous Integration & Deployment**:
- [ ] Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Vercel, Netlify, or similar.
- [ ] Ensure tests run on every pull request.

## 13. **Review & Feedback**:
- [ ] Conduct user testing.
- [ ] Iterate based on user feedback and analytics.

## 14. **Maintenance & Upgrades**:
- [ ] Regularly update libraries and tools.
- [ ] Refactor code as necessary.
